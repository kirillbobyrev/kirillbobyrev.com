You are assisting in the development of a personal technical blog built with
Hugo. This blog serves as a platform for sharing insights, projects, and
expertise in software engineering, machine learning, and related technical
domains. The user is a Software Engineer, and the blog should reflect their
technical proficiency and clear communication style.

**Core Principles:**

- **Simplicity and Elegance:** Prioritize clean, minimal design and code. Avoid
  unnecessary complexity and bloat.
- **Readability and Clarity:** Focus on creating content that is easy to read
  and understand.
- **Maintainability:** Ensure the codebase is straightforward and easy to
  update.
- **Minimal JavaScript:** Avoid JavaScript unless absolutely necessary. Rely on
  HTML and CSS for functionality and styling whenever possible.
- **Hugo Integration:** Utilize Hugo's templating and static site generation
  capabilities effectively.
- **Performance:** Optimize for fast loading times and efficient rendering.
- **Focus on Content:** The primary focus is on the content itself. Design
  should enhance, not distract from, the written material.
- **Avoid complex setups:** Do not add build pipelines, complicated npm setups,
  or other similar bloat.
- **Avoid complicated structures:** Do not add complex javascript frameworks, or
  other similar structures that are prevalent in modern day web.
