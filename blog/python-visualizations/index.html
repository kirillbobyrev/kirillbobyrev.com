<a href=https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/animation_api.html>animation functionality</a>.
Even though I have used Matplotlib for a very long time, I have apparently not
explored it well enough since it has so many features I had no idea about. I
learned about Matlotlib animations from a
<a href="https://youtu.be/yaa13eehgzo?si=rGuqQRDhVvZiOdY0">video</a> on Artem Kirsanov&rsquo;s
channel. He explains that he does <em>most</em> of his animations in Matlotlib
because it offers a more low-level API that can be leveraged to create advanced
animations.</p><p>It&rsquo;s also quite easy to embed animations into Jupyter notebooks, which is
definitely useful. I&rsquo;m excited to try it all out and get better at visual
explanations.</p></div></article></main></body></html>
