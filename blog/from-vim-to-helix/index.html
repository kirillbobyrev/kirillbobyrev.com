text editor for the terminal. After almost a decade of using Vim and Neovim, it
feels like it&rsquo;s finally time to try something new!</p><p>Although Vim&rsquo;s philosophy, key bindings, and motions have become ingrained in
both my consciousness and subconsciousness over time, I&rsquo;ve also encountered
numerous issues with it. Most notably, I tried to turn my Neovim setup into a
full IDE, when in reality it&rsquo;s a text editor that shouldn&rsquo;t be bloated with too
many plugins and tool integrations. I&rsquo;ve probably spent hundreds of hours
crafting a perfect <code>.vimrc</code> and fixing integration issues with various Linux
distributions and macOS.</p><p>Now, I&rsquo;m switching between Helix editor in the terminal and Visual Studio Code,
spending approximately half my time in each while coding.</p><h2 id=what-i-like-about-helix>What I like about Helix</h2><p>One of the things I appreciate about Helix editor is its clear niche. Rather
than trying to be an all-encompassing IDE, it&rsquo;s a simple editor with excellent
<a href=https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/>Language Server
Protocol</a> (LSP)
integration and great default settings. I love tools that are designed to serve
a specific purpose well, and I hope Helix stays focused on its core strengths as
it grows in popularity.</p><p>Another advantage of Helix is that it was built around LSP from the start. Most
other editors were built before LSP was invented, which meant that they had to
change a lot to integrate LSP into their existing architecture. LSP was a
game-changer in the world of programming language tooling, and having Helix
designed as front-end for LSP from the beginning is a huge advantage.</p><p>I also appreciate the fact that Helix is written in Rust, a modern programming
language that offers better code quality and can reduce technical debt in the
long term. Vim, by contrast, was written a long time ago, and its codebase can
be challenging to navigate. By choosing a modern language and development
environment, Helix has more streamlined development process.</p><p>Finally, Helix&rsquo;s minimalistic configuration and excellent default settings are a
breath of fresh air after the complexity of Vim and Neovim. While Vim can be a
powerful tool once you&rsquo;ve configured it to fit your preferences, getting it to
that point is incredibly difficult. Helix, on the other hand, doesn&rsquo;t require me
to learn Vimscript or Lua, install a dozen plugins, or spend hours tweaking
settings to get it just right or fix a bug.</p><p>At the time of writing, my Helix
<a href=https://github.com/kirillbobyrev/dotfiles/blob/main/.config/helix/config.toml>config</a>
is very simple:</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:2;-o-tab-size:2;tab-size:2><code class=language-toml data-lang=toml><span style=display:flex><span>theme = <span style=color:#d14>&#34;gruvbox&#34;</span>
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>[editor]
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>line-number = <span style=color:#d14>&#34;relative&#34;</span>
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>mouse = <span style=color:#000;font-weight:700>false</span>
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span><span style=color:#000;font-weight:700>true</span>-color = <span style=color:#000;font-weight:700>true</span>
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>rulers = [<span style=color:#099>80</span>]
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>bufferline = <span style=color:#d14>&#34;always&#34;</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>And it&rsquo;s extremely satisfying, because maintaining a config to keep the everyday
tools working hurts a lot. Even my Visual Studio Code configuration file is
quite long and painful to maintain.</p><h2 id=what-i-am-not-happy-with-in-helix>What I am not happy with in Helix</h2><p>While Helix editor&rsquo;s key bindings are similar to Vim&rsquo;s, they&rsquo;re not identical.
This can be a challenge for experienced Vim users, who may have developed muscle
memory around Vim&rsquo;s specific key bindings and motions. If the bindings were
completely different, it might be easier to treat them as a new skill to learn.
However, because I still use Vim plugins for Visual Studio Code and other IDEs,
maintaining two sets of similar bindings in my subconscious can be challenging.</p><p>Another problem is that Helix <a href=https://docs.helix-editor.com/>documentation</a> is
not very extensive. While it helps deal with most common problems I encounter,
I still have to go to the GitHub issues or read code whenever I need to
understand something. One of the best things about Vim is the Vimdoc and I hope
Helix gets more coverage of the existing features in a digestible manner.</p><h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h2><p>That said, I think the benefits of using Helix editor outweigh the challenges of
adjusting to its key bindings. It&rsquo;s clear niche, first-class LSP integration and
streamlined configuration make it a valuable tool for my workflow. While it may
take some time to adjust to its key bindings, I believe it will ultimately be
worth switching to from Vim if you edit code a lot in the terminal.</p></article></main><footer class="footer fixed-bottom"></footer></body></html>
