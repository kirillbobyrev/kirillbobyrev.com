Why Anki? Anki is far more than just a flashcard appâ€”itâ€™s a robust system built on the principles of spaced repetition. This approach optimizes your study sessions by spacing out reviews of material just before youâ€™re likely to forget, making your learning process both efficient and effective."><meta property="og:locale" content="en"><meta property="og:type" content="article"><meta property="article:section" content="blog"><meta property="article:published_time" content="2025-01-02T00:00:00+00:00"><meta property="article:modified_time" content="2025-03-23T19:06:32-07:00"><meta property="og:image" content="https://kirillbobyrev.com/images/twitter.png"><meta name=twitter:card content="summary_large_image"><meta name=twitter:image content="https://kirillbobyrev.com/images/twitter.png"><meta name=twitter:title content="Anki: the ultimate tool for learning"><meta name=twitter:description content="Being a Software Engineer means constantly learning new things, and streamlining the learning process while making sure I donâ€™t forget things I already learned along the way is an important topic for me.

the learning process while making sure I don&rsquo;t forget things I already learned
along the way is an important topic for me. <a href=https://apps.ankiweb.net/>Anki</a> is
one of the best tools I found for myself to make the learning process enjoyable
and efficient.</p><h2 id=why-anki>Why Anki?</h2><p>Anki is far more than just a flashcard appâ€”it&rsquo;s a robust system built on the
principles of <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition>spaced
repetition</a>. This approach
optimizes your study sessions by spacing out reviews of material just before
youâ€™re likely to forget, making your learning process both efficient and
effective.</p><h3 id=key-features>Key Features</h3><ul><li><strong>Cross-Platform & Free (with one iOS exception):</strong> Whether you&rsquo;re using
Windows, Mac, Linux, or even Android, Anki has you covered. The
synchronization feature lets you pick up right where you left off on any
device.</li><li><strong>Customizable Card Creation:</strong> The app supports basic formatting, LaTeX for
complex mathematical formulas, and even multimedia. This flexibility is crucial
when you need to study diverse topics.</li><li><strong>Organized Learning:</strong> With its hierarchical deck and tagging system, Anki
makes it easy to keep your flashcards organized. Importing and exporting decks
further simplifies sharing and collaboration.</li><li><strong>Enhanced Study Techniques:</strong> Anki features really advanced and easy-to-use
techniques like <a href=https://docs.ankiweb.net/editing.html#cloze-deletion>cloze
deletion</a> and <a href=https://docs.ankiweb.net/editing.html#image-occlusion>image
occlusion</a>.</li></ul><h2 id=personal-experience>Personal Experience</h2><p>Reflecting on my academic journey, I often wished I had access to a tool like
Anki during my school and university days. Now, as I refresh my mathematical
knowledge and navigate through Computer Science literature, Anki has become
indispensable. By memorizing core definitions and concepts, I find that I can
derive most of the complex results I need, making it an ideal study companion.</p><p>Even though Anki might have a &ldquo;DIY&rdquo; flavorâ€”lacking a highly curated list of
decks for certain topicsâ€”this very characteristic encourages you to tailor your
learning experience. It pushes you to engage more deeply with the material, a
practice thatâ€™s particularly rewarding when mastering challenging subjects.</p><h2 id=the-bigger-picture>The Bigger Picture</h2><p>Itâ€™s surprising that despite its powerful capabilities, many peers (even within
the Software Engineering community) don&rsquo;t know about Anki. In contrast,
mainstream apps like Duolingo enjoy widespread recognition. However, for those
who are serious about learning and retaining knowledge, Ankiâ€™s customizable
approach offers a huge advantage (though at the cost of an additional
maintenance burden).</p><h2 id=final-thoughts>Final Thoughts</h2><p>Everyoneâ€™s learning style is unique, and while Anki may not be the perfect
solution for every discipline, its utility in reinforcing foundational knowledge
is undeniable. Whether you&rsquo;re a student or a lifelong learner, integrating Anki
into your study routine might be worth your while.</p></div></article></main></body></html>
