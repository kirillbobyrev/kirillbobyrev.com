while studying in school and university. It is a very powerful flashcard app
that uses advanced <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition>spaced
repetition</a> techniques to help
learn and retain important information.</p><p>Anki supports everything that I really need natively: it&rsquo;s free (except for iOS
app), cross-device synchronization, supports some basic formatting for the
cards and LaTeX typesetting for mathematical formulas. The cards can be easily
organized using a hierarchy of decks and tags. They can be imported or exported
through sharing decks, too.</p><p>The app is very helpful to me now that I&rsquo;m refreshing a lot of my mathematical
knowledge and study Computer Science books and papers. I&rsquo;m having a lot of fun
studying and building small projects to apply new knowledge, but it&rsquo;s also very
important to retain the majority of it. Everyone&rsquo;s learning style is certainly
different, but I definitely think that the most succesful way for me to study
is to memorize the fundamental definitions and ideas from some topic, from
which I can usually derive most of the results. It&rsquo;s also ideal for students,
because the app is very easy to use and powerful as is.</p><p>While probably not as useful for Mathematics and Computer Science, there are
plenty of features that enhance cards generation, such as <a href=https://docs.ankiweb.net/editing.html#cloze-deletion>cloze
deletion</a> or <a href=https://docs.ankiweb.net/editing.html#image-occlusion>image
occlusion</a>.</p><p>What&rsquo;s surprising to me is that many people I know (even those in Software
Engineering field) have never heard of Anki, despite knowing (and possibly even
using) apps like Duolingo. An obvious drawback of Anki is that it doesn&rsquo;t have
a very high quality curated list of decks for at least few topics and it has
&ldquo;DIY&rdquo; flavor but that&rsquo;s probably also the reason the app is so useful, too.</p></article></main><footer class="footer fixed-bottom"></footer></body></html>
