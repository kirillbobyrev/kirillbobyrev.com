just absorbing information - it&rsquo;s retaining what I&rsquo;ve learned while continuing
to grow. <a href=https://apps.ankiweb.net/>Anki</a> has become my go-to tool for making
learning both enjoyable and efficient.</p><h2 id=what-makes-anki-special>What Makes Anki Special</h2><p>Anki isn&rsquo;t just another flashcard app. It&rsquo;s built on <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition>spaced
repetition</a>, a learning
technique that shows you material right before you&rsquo;re about to forget it. This
timing makes your study sessions incredibly efficient.</p><h3 id=key-features>Key Features</h3><ul><li><strong>Works everywhere:</strong> Free on Windows, Mac, Linux, and Android (iOS costs
$25). Everything syncs perfectly between devices.</li><li><strong>Flexible content:</strong> Basic text, LaTeX math formulas, images, audio - you
can study anything. This flexibility is crucial when tackling diverse topics.</li><li><strong>Smart organization:</strong> Hierarchical decks and tags keep everything
organized. You can import and export decks to share with others.</li><li><strong>Advanced techniques:</strong> Features like <a href=https://docs.ankiweb.net/editing.html#cloze-deletion>cloze
deletion</a> and <a href=https://docs.ankiweb.net/editing.html#image-occlusion>image
occlusion</a> make
studying more effective.</li></ul><h2 id=my-experience>My Experience</h2><p>I wish I&rsquo;d discovered Anki during university. Now, as I refresh my math
knowledge and work through computer science papers, it&rsquo;s become essential. By
memorizing core definitions and concepts, I can derive most complex results I
need.</p><p>Anki has a DIY feel - you won&rsquo;t find polished, pre-made decks for every topic.
But this actually helps. Creating your own cards forces you to engage with the
material more deeply, which is especially valuable for challenging subjects.</p><h2 id=why-more-people-should-know-about-it>Why More People Should Know About It</h2><p>It&rsquo;s surprising how few engineers know about Anki, especially compared to
mainstream apps like Duolingo. For serious learners who want to retain
knowledge long-term, Anki&rsquo;s customizable approach offers huge advantages. The
trade-off is that it requires more setup and maintenance.</p><h2 id=bottom-line>Bottom Line</h2><p>Anki isn&rsquo;t perfect for every learning style or subject. But for building and
maintaining foundational knowledge, it&rsquo;s unmatched. If you&rsquo;re serious about
learning - whether as a student or lifelong learner - it&rsquo;s worth trying.</p></article></main></body></html>
