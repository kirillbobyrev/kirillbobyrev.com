while studying in school and university. It is a very powerful flashcard app
that uses advanced &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition">spaced
repetition&lt;/a> techniques to help
learn and retain important information.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Anki supports everything that I really need natively: it&amp;rsquo;s free (except for iOS
app), cross-device synchronization, supports some basic formatting for the
cards and LaTeX typesetting for mathematical formulas. The cards can be easily
organized using a hierarchy of decks and tags. They can be imported or exported
through sharing decks, too.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Analyzing long win streaks in online chess</title><link>https://kirillbobyrev.com/blog/analyzing-long-win-streaks/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kirillbobyrev.com/blog/analyzing-long-win-streaks/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>TL;DR&lt;/strong>: In-depth analysis of recent data suggests a high likelihood of Hikaru
Nakamura achieving a 55-game winning streak in online blitz, based on thousands
of his games played this year (and even more likely given that Hikaru just
crossed 35,000 blitz games mark on Chess.com alone). Similarly, longest streaks
by Magnus Carlsen (32 wins), Nihal Sarin (22 wins), and Daniel Naroditsky (33
wins) align with statistical expectations. The occurrence of both short (10+
wins) and long (15+ wins) streaks among these elite players is also found to be
probable and not out of the ordinary. A simple explanation of Hikaru&amp;rsquo;s
performance is that he plays an enormous number of games online, is highly
skilled and (on average) has much weaker opponents than his peers (moreover, he
specifically &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDUCMEgYKrE&amp;amp;t=435s">mentions&lt;/a>
cherry-picking opponents in order to score many points and create good content).&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
