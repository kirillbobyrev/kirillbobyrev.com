The challenge isn&amp;rsquo;t
just absorbing information - it&amp;rsquo;s retaining what I&amp;rsquo;ve learned while continuing
to grow. &lt;a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki&lt;/a> has become my go-to tool for making
learning both enjoyable and efficient.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-makes-anki-special">What Makes Anki Special&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Anki isn&amp;rsquo;t just another flashcard app. It&amp;rsquo;s built on &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition">spaced
repetition&lt;/a>, a learning
technique that shows you material right before you&amp;rsquo;re about to forget it. This
timing makes your study sessions incredibly efficient.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Analyzing long win streaks in online chess</title><link>https://kirillbobyrev.com/blog/analyzing-long-win-streaks/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kirillbobyrev.com/blog/analyzing-long-win-streaks/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>TL;DR&lt;/strong> Vladimir Kramnik has recently suggested that Hikaru Nakamura&amp;rsquo;s
exceptional winning streaks in online blitz chess might indicate suspicious
activity, potentially hinting at cheating. I was curious whether this claim has
any ground and decided to analyze the data myself. I gathered data on Hikaru&amp;rsquo;s
games on Chess.com and compared his performance to other top players. I found
that Hikaru&amp;rsquo;s long winning streaks are statistically probable given his high
rating and the significantly lower average rating of his opponents. I also found
that other top players, such as Daniel Naroditsky, have similar patterns of
winning streaks, which suggests that these streaks are not unique to Hikaru.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
