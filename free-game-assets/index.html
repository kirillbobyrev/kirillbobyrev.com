<span class=monospaced>3 min to read</span><p>Today I Leanred: <a href=https://itch.io>itch.io</a> offers thousands of <a href=https://itch.io/game-assets>game
assets</a> for free. Most of them are free to use even
for the commercial purposes: this is great for solo game developers and
enthusiasts willing to play around and create their own games with stunning
visuals.</p><h2 id=context>Context</h2><p>Growing up, I loved playing computer games. That ultimately led me to learning
how to program, because I always wanted to create one. Being a teenager, I
picked up C# and Unity and participated in early stage of <a href=https://store.steampowered.com/app/230190/War_for_the_Overworld/>War for the
Overworld</a>
(spiritual successor of Dungeon Keeper) game development. But my biggest passion
is probably 2D (platformer or top-down) rogue-like genre, and I always dreamed
to create my own game. Eventually, I became a Software Engineer, but my biggest
one was always this: I know almost nothing about the graphics, so even if I
create a game it wouldn&rsquo;t be visually appealing and fun to play. The only way I
would be able to create games is to find an artist who would be willing to spend
time and effort building the game with me and at that point it doesn&rsquo;t feel any
different from work.</p><p>Seeing <a href=https://bevyengine.org/>Bevy</a> engine reignited my passion for game
development, and I started looking for video tutorials on YouTube to learn more
about the engine. It turns out there are plenty of tutorials available for
making 2D games and, after seeing few of them, I started noticing that the game
assets in many of these tutorials are the same! That means, they&rsquo;re likely to
take them from some place that has plenty of game assets!</p><p>To my delight, I discovered that there are hundreds and thousands of game asset
sets that are <a href=https://itch.io/game-assets/top-rated>available</a> on itch.io
either for free, or for a reasonable price.</p><p>Here are some of my favorites from exploring the collection:</p><ul><li><a href=https://0x72.itch.io/dungeontileset-ii>Dungeon Tileset II</a></li><li><a href=https://anokolisa.itch.io/crawler-dungeon-prison>Pixel Crawler</a></li><li><a href=https://pixelfrog-assets.itch.io/tiny-swords>Tiny Swords</a></li><li><a href=https://pixelfrog-assets.itch.io/kings-and-pigs>King and Pigs</a></li><li><a href=https://trevor-pupkin.itch.io/tech-dungeon-roguelite>Tech Dungeon Roguelite</a></li></ul><p>There&rsquo;s also an option to donate to the artist whose work you&rsquo;re using, so it&rsquo;s
a great way to support them while simultaneously trying out different ideas. A
lot of these sets focus on precisely what I am looking for: 2D environments for
rogue-like games!</p><p>This is certainly a great discovery and I&rsquo;m curious to try some of these
tilesets out and finally created my own video game and learn more about Game
Development!</p><h2 id=bonus>Bonus</h2><p>itch.io also hosts numerous <a href=https://itch.io/jams>Game Jams</a> (hackathons of
game development). Each game jam proposes a theme that participants should
incorporate into their games and complete them in a limited amount of time.</p><p>That probably eliminates another excuse to avoid making games for fun that I
have: not having an idea of a game or striving to make a perfect game that would
feel complete. Having limited time and fun idea like making <a href=https://itch.io/jam/20-second-game-jam>games that last
exactly 20 seconds</a> should solve these
problems and encourage more experimentation and inflict infinite fun!</p></article></main><footer class="footer fixed-bottom"><div class="container center"><a href=https://github.com/kirillbobyrev/ title=GitHub aria-label=GitHub><div class="fab fa-github fa-2x fa-icon" aria-hidden=true></div></a><a href=https://twitter.com/kirillbobyrev/ title=Twitter aria-label=Twitter><div class="fab fa-twitter fa-2x fa-icon" aria-hidden=true></div></a><a href=https://linkedin.com/in/kirillbobyrev/ title=LinkedIn aria-label=LinkedIn><div class="fab fa-linkedin fa-2x fa-icon" aria-hidden=true></div></a><a href=https://instagram.com/cybobyrev/ title=Instagram aria-label=Instagram><div class="fab fa-instagram fa-2x fa-icon" aria-hidden=true></div></a><a href=https://t.me/kirillbobyrev/ title=Telegram aria-label=Telegram><div class="fab fa-telegram fa-2x fa-icon" aria-hidden=true></div></a></div></footer></body></html>
