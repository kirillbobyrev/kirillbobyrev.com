# Copilot instructions

## Overall project context

The project is a personal technical blog built with Hugo. It's a static website
focused on software engineering, machine learning, and related technical topics.
The blog's content includes the user's thoughts, ideas, and projects, reflecting
their expertise as a Software Engineer. The website is implemented using plain
HTML, CSS, and minimal JavaScript within the Hugo framework. The blog's style is
minimalistic and elegant, emphasizing readability and ease of content updates.

## Code generation guidelines

- **Style:** Code should be clean, readable, and easy to understand. Favor
  clarity over extreme conciseness. Follow common coding conventions for each
  language.
- **Hugo context:** Be mindful that the project is a Hugo website. When
  generating HTML, CSS, or JavaScript, ensure it is compatible with Hugo's
  templating system and static site structure.
- **Minimalism and Elegance:** Reflect the blog's minimalistic yet elegant style
  in generated code. Avoid unnecessary complexity or visual clutter. For CSS,
  use a simple and elegant approach. For JavaScript, keep it minimal and only
  for essential interactive features.
- **Readability and Maintainability:**  Prioritize code that is easy to read and
  modify. Use meaningful variable and function names. Structure code logically
  and keep functions short and focused. Comment code where necessary to explain
  complex logic, especially in JavaScript if used.
- **Technical Accuracy:**  Given the blog's technical focus, ensure that any
  generated code is technically sound and accurate. For machine learning or
  software engineering examples, the code should be functional and illustrative
  of best practices.
- **Content Tone:**  Maintain a technical yet personal tone in generated
  content, mirroring the blog's style of sharing thoughts and ideas. The
  language should be clear, concise, and engaging for a technically inclined
  audience.

## Specific instructions by file type

- **HTML (.html):**
  - Generate well-structured and semantic HTML5.
  - Follow Hugo templating conventions for content and layouts.
  - Ensure HTML is valid and accessible.
  - Reflect the blog's minimalistic design in the HTML structure.

- **CSS (.css):**
  - Write clean and efficient CSS to maintain the blog's elegant and minimalistic style.
  - Use CSS for styling and layout, avoiding inline styles.
  - Prioritize readability in CSS code.
  - Consider responsiveness for different screen sizes if relevant.

- **JavaScript (.js):**
  - Keep JavaScript code to an absolute minimum, as per the blog's design.
  - Use JavaScript only for essential interactive features.
  - Write efficient and well-commented JavaScript if necessary.
  - Ensure compatibility with modern browsers.

## Examples

- **Good Example (HTML):** Generating a simple, semantic HTML structure for a
  blog post with clear content sections.
- **Good Example (CSS):** Creating a minimalistic CSS stylesheet that focuses
  on typography, spacing, and basic color schemes for readability.
- **Good Example (JavaScript):**  Implementing a minimal JavaScript function for
  a specific interaction, like a theme toggle, with clear and concise code.

- **Bad Example (HTML):** Generating complex, deeply nested HTML with
  unnecessary divs and unclear semantic structure.
- **Bad Example (CSS):** Creating overly complex CSS with excessive animations
  or visual effects that detract from readability.
- **Bad Example (JavaScript):** Adding JavaScript for non-essential features or
  writing convoluted and poorly commented JavaScript.

## Tone and Style

- **Technical and Thoughtful:** Adopt a tone that is both technically informed
  and reflective, suitable for a personal blog sharing thoughts and ideas.
- **Clear and Concise:** Generated content should be clear, direct, and to the
  point, avoiding jargon where simpler terms suffice.
- **Engaging and Informative:** Aim to generate content that is not only
  technically accurate but also engaging and informative for readers interested in
  software engineering and machine learning.
