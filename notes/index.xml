anticipation of the GTA 6 release later this year) to try out console gaming.
The experience is noticeably different. The UI/UX feels a bit outdated, the
controller isn’t as comfortable, and the pricing model (with mandatory PS Plus
for some features like online play in many games) is more aggressive than
Steam’s. Still, the plug‐and‐play convenience is a big plus if you’d rather skip
building, setting up and maintaining your own PC.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Vibe coding is real</title><link>https://kirillbobyrev.com/notes/vibe-coding-is-real/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Mar 2025 22:47:39 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://kirillbobyrev.com/notes/vibe-coding-is-real/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve long been skeptical of &amp;ldquo;vibe coding&amp;rdquo; and AI-driven tools like Cursor and
GitHub Copilot. However, the recent Agents updates completely changed my
perspective. After giving them a genuine try, I was able to quickly build a
clean, &amp;ldquo;Twitter-like&amp;rdquo; feed for my personal blog notes in just a few minutes.
Impressively, Claude 3.7 Sonnet Thinking nailed the implementation in a single
go, and I&amp;rsquo;m genuinely pleased with the outcome.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While crafting blog posts and personal notes brings me joy, coding HTML and
wrestling with CSS rarely does. Tools like Copilot and Cursor have significantly
boosted my productivity, letting me focus more on writing and less on tedious
styling.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
