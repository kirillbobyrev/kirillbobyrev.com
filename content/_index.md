My name is Kirill Bobyrev. I'm a Software Engineer working at Waymo in the :us:
Silicon Valley. I'm passionate about machine learning and reinforcement
learning, efficient algorithms, high-performance code, distributed systems and
low-level programming.

## Work and education

I grew up in :ru: Moscow and graduated from
[MIPT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow_Institute_of_Physics_and_Technology)
with a Bachelor’s degree in applied mathematics and physics. During my first
year at the university, I discovered my interest in computer science and started
participating in competitive programming contests. Later, I got the chance to
take part in [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/),
where I built a tool using Clang to find copypasted code in open-source projects
(see
[poster](https://github.com/kirillbobyrev/code-clone-detection-llvm-devmtg15-poster)).
This led to an internship offer at Google. During my internship, I worked on
developing static analysis tools for C++ like
[clang-rename](https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-rename.html) and
[Clang-Tidy](https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/index.html). It was super
fun, and I learned a lot about how Clang and compilers work behind the scenes.

My second internship was also in Google Munich. This time I have worked on
[clangd](https://clangd.llvm.org/), Clang-based language server for C++. I have
built the code completion search engine which resulted in up to 100x performance
improvement! I carefully documented project's
[design](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1C-A6PGT6TynyaX4PXyExNMiGmJ2jL1UwV91Kyx11gOI/)
and [presented the results](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhxrFor3VyQ) at the
LLVM Developers Meeting.

After graduation I joined the team at :de: Google Munich where
I was an intern. At Google I was working on clangd, Clang and LLVM. Among other
things, I have built [Remote Index](https://clangd.llvm.org/design/remote-index)
and [Include Cleaner](https://clangd.llvm.org/design/include-cleaner). In the
absence of a Product Manager in our team, I acted as one - learning what
features our users want, conducting UX interviews and surveys, processing
feedback and prioritizing the most pressing issues. I previously studied in
Yandex School of Management
([ШМЯ](https://academy.yandex.ru/schools/management)) which helped me develop
enough expertise to take on Product Manager or Project Manager responsibilities.

In 2022 I have joined [Waymo](https://waymo.com/), Google's self-driving cars
unit, and moved to :us: California. At Waymo I build Machine Learning models
that improve [Simulation](https://waymo.com/blog/2021/07/simulation-city)
realism and ensure safety of our self-driving system.

My favorite languages are C++, Rust and Python.

## Outside of work

- When I'm not working, I enjoy training Jiu Jitsu, playing chess and
  traveling.
- I like competitive programming and studying computer science (here's a
  [collection](https://github.com/kirillbobyrev/computer-science-resources) of
  resources I found for myself).
- I speak English, Russian and German.
- I'm also living with two crazy Abyssinian kittens :cat:, check out [their
  Instagram](https://instagram.com/dixie_pixie_cats).
