I'm a software engineer at Waymo in :us: San Francisco Bay Area. I work on
simulation and build machine learning models to make self-driving vehicles
safer.

### Work & Education

I grew up in :ru: Moscow and earned my bachelor’s degree in applied mathematics
and physics from
[MIPT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow_Institute_of_Physics_and_Technology).
My journey into computer science started during my first year at university
through competitive programming. Soon after, I participated in [Google Summer of
Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/), where I developed a Clang-based
tool to detect copypasted code in open-source projects (you can check out the
[poster](https://github.com/kirillbobyrev/code-clone-detection-llvm-devmtg15-poster)
for details). This project led to an internship at Google, where I had a blast
working on static analysis tools for C++, including
[clang-rename](https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-rename.html) and
[Clang-Tidy](https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/index.html). I gained
invaluable insights into the inner workings of Clang and compilers.

My next challenge was in Munich with Google, where I contributed to
[clangd](https://clangd.llvm.org/), the Clang-based language server for C++. I
built a code completion search engine that boosted performance by up to 100x! I
documented the project’s
[design](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1C-A6PGT6TynyaX4PXyExNMiGmJ2jL1UwV91Kyx11gOI/)
and showcased my results at the LLVM Developers Meeting through a
[presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhxrFor3VyQ). After graduation,
I rejoined the team in :de: Munich at Google, working extensively on clangd,
Clang, and LLVM. I developed key tools like [Remote
Index](https://clangd.llvm.org/design/remote-index) and [Include
Cleaner](https://clangd.llvm.org/design/include-cleaner). In a team without a
dedicated product manager, I stepped up to bridge that gap - conducting UX
interviews, running surveys, gathering feedback, and prioritizing user needs. My
time at the Yandex School of Management
([ШМЯ](https://academy.yandex.ru/schools/management)) also equipped me with the
skills to manage product and project initiatives.

In 2022, I embarked on a new adventure by joining [Waymo](https://waymo.com/),
the pioneering self-driving car unit of Google, and moved to California. At
Waymo, I build machine learning models that enhance simulation realism and help
ensure the safety of our self-driving systems.

### Outside of Work

When I'm not working, you'll find me training in Jiu Jitsu, playing opponents in
chess, or exploring new places. I also enjoy competitive programming and
learning more about computer science and machine learning (through a [collection
of resources](https://github.com/kirillbobyrev/computer-science-resources) I've
gathered). I’m fluent in English, Russian, and German, and I live with two
mischievous Abyssinian cats.
