I build machine learning models at Waymo and make the simulation more realisitc.

## My Journey

My path started with competitive programming as a physics and math student at
[MIPT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow_Institute_of_Physics_and_Technology).
I took a gap year to participate in [Google Summer of
Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/), where I built
[tools](https://github.com/kirillbobyrev/code-clone-detection-llvm-devmtg15-poster)
to detect duplicate code in open-source projects - work that caught Google's
attention and launched my career.

At Google, I worked on making C++ development faster and more reliable. I built
many features for [clangd](https://clangd.llvm.org/), including [search
engine](https://youtu.be/VhxrFor3VyQ) that made code completion 100x faster,
[include cleaner](https://clangd.llvm.org/guides/include-cleaner) and renaming
engine. Beyond the technical work, I became the team's unofficial product
manager - running user interviews, analyzing feedback, and shaping our roadmap
to serve millions of developers worldwide.

At Waymo, I work on machine learning models for autonomous vehicle simulation.
My team focuses on making simulations more realistic, robust, and performant to
help ensure the safety of self-driving systems. It's challenging work at the
intersection of ML and safety-critical systems.

## Beyond Code

I really enjoy learning something new - practicing Jiu Jitsu techniques,
exploring the chess openings, or traveling to new places. I speak English,
Russian, and German and share my home with three crazy Abyssinian cats.
