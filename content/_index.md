I build machine learning models at [Waymo](https://waymo.com/) that make
self-driving cars safer by improving how we simulate real-world scenarios.
Every model I create helps us test millions of driving situations before our
cars encounter them on actual roads.

### My Journey

My path started with competitive programming as a physics and math student at
[MIPT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow_Institute_of_Physics_and_Technology).
This led to [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/),
where I built
[tools](https://github.com/kirillbobyrev/code-clone-detection-llvm-devmtg15-poster)
to detect duplicate code in open-source projects - work that caught Google's
attention and launched my career.

At Google, I spent years making C++ development faster and more reliable. I
created [clang-rename](https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-rename.html) for safe
code refactoring and [built a search engine](https://youtu.be/VhxrFor3VyQ) for
[clangd](https://clangd.llvm.org/) that made code completion 100x faster.
Beyond the technical work, I became the team's unofficial product manager -
running user interviews, analyzing feedback, and shaping our roadmap to serve
millions of developers worldwide.

The transition to autonomous vehicles at Waymo opened up an entirely new
challenge: using ML to create realistic simulations that help self-driving cars
learn without putting anyone at risk. It's the perfect blend of my systems
background and fascination with machine learning.

### Beyond Code

I'm most alive when learning something new - whether that's mastering a new Jiu
Jitsu technique, analyzing chess positions, or exploring unfamiliar cities. I
speak English, Russian, and German and share my home with two crazy Abyssinian
cats.
