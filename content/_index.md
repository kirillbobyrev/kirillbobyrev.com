Hi, I'm Kirill Bobyrev — a Software Engineer at Waymo in :us: Silicon Valley,
passionate about pushing the boundaries of machine learning, reinforcement
learning, efficient algorithms, high-performance code, distributed systems, and
low-level programming.

## Work & Education

I was raised in :ru: Moscow and earned my Bachelor’s degree in applied
mathematics and physics from
[MIPT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow_Institute_of_Physics_and_Technology).
My journey into computer science started during my first year at university
through competitive programming contests. Soon after, I participated in [Google
Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/), where I developed a
Clang-based tool to detect copypasted code in open-source projects (you can
check out the
[poster](https://github.com/kirillbobyrev/code-clone-detection-llvm-devmtg15-poster)
for details). This project led to an internship at Google, where I had a blast
working on static analysis tools for C++, including
[clang-rename](https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-rename.html) and
[Clang-Tidy](https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/index.html). I gained
invaluable insights into the inner workings of Clang and compilers.

My next challenge was in Munich with Google, where I contributed to
[clangd](https://clangd.llvm.org/), the Clang-based language server for C++. I
built a code completion search engine that boosted performance by up to 100x! I
documented the project’s
[design](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1C-A6PGT6TynyaX4PXyExNMiGmJ2jL1UwV91Kyx11gOI/)
and showcased my results at the LLVM Developers Meeting through a
[presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhxrFor3VyQ).

After graduation, I rejoined the team in :de: Munich at Google, working
extensively on clangd, Clang, and LLVM. I developed key tools like [Remote
Index](https://clangd.llvm.org/design/remote-index) and [Include
Cleaner](https://clangd.llvm.org/design/include-cleaner). In a team without a
dedicated Product Manager, I stepped up to bridge that gap—conducting UX
interviews, running surveys, gathering feedback, and prioritizing user needs. My
time at the Yandex School of Management
([ШМЯ](https://academy.yandex.ru/schools/management)) also equipped me with the
skills to manage product and project initiatives.

In 2022, I embarked on a new adventure by joining [Waymo](https://waymo.com/),
the pioneering self-driving car unit of Google, and moved to California. At
Waymo, I build machine learning models that enhance simulation realism and help
ensure the safety of our self-driving systems.

## Outside of Work

When I'm not immersed in code, you'll find me training in Jiu Jitsu, challenging
opponents in chess, or exploring new places. I also enjoy competitive
programming and diving deeper into computer science — feel free to browse my
[collection of
resources](https://github.com/kirillbobyrev/computer-science-resources). I’m
fluent in English, Russian, and German, and I share my life with two mischievous
Abyssinian kittens :cat:. Check out [their
Instagram](https://instagram.com/dixie_pixie_cats) for a peek into our
fun-filled days.

Welcome to my blog — I’m excited to share my journey and insights with you!
