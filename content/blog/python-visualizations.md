I recently started watching a lot of educational videos on YouTube and was
fascinated by the quality of both explanations and the accompanying
visualizations. Animations and visual explanations both help keep the attention
and also improve my understanding a lot, since I'm definitely a visual learner.

[YouTube]("https://www.youtube.com/c/3blue1brown" "3Blue1Brown" ) is probably
one of the most popular channels that features great visuals to explain a large
number of interesting concepts of Mathematics and Computer Science. Channel
author even created and open-sourced the software that he uses for all
animations and put it on GitHub: [3b1b/manim](https://github.com/3b1b/manim). But apparently it
was forked into
[ManimCommunity/manim](https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim), which features an enhanced version of the
package with more thorough testing, documentation and better user experience.
The community also has active Discord and a bunch of impressive
[examples](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/examples.html).

But what was even more surprising to me is that apparently Matplotlib also has
[animation functionality](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/animation_api.html).
Even though I have used Matplotlib for a very long time, I have apparently not
explored it well enough since it has so many features I had no idea about. I
learned about Matlotlib animations from
[YouTube]("https://youtu.be/yaa13eehgzo?si=rGuqQRDhVvZiOdY0" "Artem Kirsanov's video").
He explains that he does _most_ of his animations in Matlotlib because it offers
a more low-level API that can be leveraged to create advanced animations.

It's also quite easy to embed animations into Jupyter notebooks, which is
definitely useful. I'm excited to try it all out and get better at visual
explanations.
