As a software engineer, I'm constantly learning new things. The challenge isn't
just absorbing information - it's retaining what I've learned while continuing
to grow. [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) has become my go-to tool for making
learning both enjoyable and efficient.

## What Makes Anki Special

Anki isn't just another flashcard app. It's built with focus on spaced
repetition, a learning technique that shows you material right before you're
about to forget it. This timing makes the study sessions incredibly efficient.

### Key Features

- **Works everywhere:** Free on Windows, Mac, Linux, and Android (iOS costs
  $25). Everything syncs perfectly between devices.
- **Flexible content:** Basic text, LaTeX math formulas, images, audio - you
  can study anything. This flexibility is crucial when tackling diverse topics.
- **Smart organization:** Hierarchical decks and tags keep everything
  organized. You can import and export decks to share with others.
- **Advanced techniques:** Features like [cloze
  deletion](https://docs.ankiweb.net/editing.html#cloze-deletion) and [image
  occlusion](https://docs.ankiweb.net/editing.html#image-occlusion) make
  studying more effective.

## My Experience

I wish I'd discovered Anki during university. Now, as I refresh my math
knowledge and work through computer science papers, it's become essential. By
memorizing core definitions and concepts, I can derive most complex results I
need.

Anki has a DIY feel - you won't find polished, pre-made decks for every topic.
But this actually helps. Creating your own cards forces you to engage with the
material more deeply, which is especially valuable for challenging subjects.

## Why More People Should Know About It

It's surprising how few engineers know about Anki, especially compared to
mainstream apps like Duolingo. For serious learners who want to retain
knowledge long-term, Anki's customizable approach offers huge advantages. The
trade-off is that it requires more setup and maintenance.

## Takeaway

Anki isn't perfect for every learning style or subject. But for building and
maintaining foundational knowledge, it's unmatched. If you're serious about
learning - whether as a student or lifelong learner - it's worth trying.
