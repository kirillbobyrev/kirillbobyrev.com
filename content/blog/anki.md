Being a Software Engineer means constantly learning new things, and streamlining
the learning process while making sure I don't forget things I already learned
along the way is an important topic for me. [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) is
one of the best tools I found for myself to make the learning process enjoyable
and efficient.

## Why Anki?

Anki is far more than just a flashcard app—it's a robust system built on the
principles of [spaced
repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition). This approach
optimizes your study sessions by spacing out reviews of material just before
you’re likely to forget, making your learning process both efficient and
effective.

### Key Features

- **Cross-Platform & Free (with one iOS exception):** Whether you're using
  Windows, Mac, Linux, or even Android, Anki has you covered. The
  synchronization feature lets you pick up right where you left off on any
  device.
- **Customizable Card Creation:** The app supports basic formatting, LaTeX for
  complex mathematical formulas, and even multimedia. This flexibility is crucial
  when you need to study diverse topics.
- **Organized Learning:** With its hierarchical deck and tagging system, Anki
  makes it easy to keep your flashcards organized. Importing and exporting decks
  further simplifies sharing and collaboration.
- **Enhanced Study Techniques:** Anki features really advanced and easy-to-use
  techniques like [cloze
  deletion](https://docs.ankiweb.net/editing.html#cloze-deletion) and [image
  occlusion](https://docs.ankiweb.net/editing.html#image-occlusion).

## Personal Experience

Reflecting on my academic journey, I often wished I had access to a tool like
Anki during my school and university days. Now, as I refresh my mathematical
knowledge and navigate through Computer Science literature, Anki has become
indispensable. By memorizing core definitions and concepts, I find that I can
derive most of the complex results I need, making it an ideal study companion.

Even though Anki might have a "DIY" flavor—lacking a highly curated list of
decks for certain topics—this very characteristic encourages you to tailor your
learning experience. It pushes you to engage more deeply with the material, a
practice that’s particularly rewarding when mastering challenging subjects.

## The Bigger Picture

It’s surprising that despite its powerful capabilities, many peers (even within
the Software Engineering community) don't know about Anki. In contrast,
mainstream apps like Duolingo enjoy widespread recognition. However, for those
who are serious about learning and retaining knowledge, Anki’s customizable
approach offers a huge advantage (though at the cost of an additional
maintenance burden).

## Final Thoughts

Everyone’s learning style is unique, and while Anki may not be the perfect
solution for every discipline, its utility in reinforcing foundational knowledge
is undeniable. Whether you're a student or a lifelong learner, integrating Anki
into your study routine might be worth your while.
