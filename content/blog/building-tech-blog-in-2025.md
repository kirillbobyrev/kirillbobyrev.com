I wanted to have my own corner of the Web for a very long time, and over the
years I have looked into numerous tools and platforms (Jekyll, Substack,
bearblog, Posthaven, Twitter, Hugo to name a few). There was always some feature
I missed or something I didn't really like, so I never actually started to blog
"properly". I did want to write mostly about my work, because I think many
experiences are worth "documenting" (a better word here?) not only for myself,
but also for friends, family and potential employers who are curious about what
I'm working on, building in my spare time and reading. What's more, I feel like
having a place where I can express my thoughts freely and "own" as much as one
can own a small piece of the internet is especially valuable in the age of LLMs.

All of the tools I have mentioned are great, but I feel like recently I have
finally foudn a setup that really works for me and that is aesthetically
pleasing. If you want to build a blog in 2025, you may find my setup really
useful and make use of the tools that I have found.

## What I want from my blog

After many years of obsessing over the "right blogging setup" I have finally
accepted that what I truly need is to just start writing. I want a setup that is

- As simple as possible
- As reliable as possible
- As stable as possible

Which mostly means that all I want to do is writing in Markdown format and
publishing static HTML + CSS generated from it. I want my blog to be reasonably
extensible if I want to add specific sections/pages (e.g. resume, Twitter-like
feed, projects page)

I don't want to be at the mercy of a single platform that can change from
something I like to something I don't want to be a part of (looking at you,
Twitter).

There's nothing more stable than plain HTML + CSS hosted somewhere statically,
so

## The dream setup

- Hugo + GitHub Pages + GitHub Actions
- Tailwind CSS + Claude Code for design
- Devcontainers + Codespaces + VSCode
- Hosted at [kirillbobyrev/kirillbobyrev.com]
