For a long time I wanted to have a tech blog and to write about things that
excite me. I've looked into many tools and platforms: Jekyll, Substack,
bearblog, Posthaven, Twitter, Hugo to name a few. There was always some feature
I missed or something I didn't really like, so I never actually started a blog.
Looking back, of course I should have just picked any platform that worked and
started writing, but better late than never!

But after years of struggling, I have finally found a setup that I really like
and enjoy working with. If you're also thinking about starting a blog and want
to "own" it as much as possible, you can use the tools that I have recently
found.

## What I want from my blog

After many years of obsessing over the "right blogging setup" I have finally
accepted that what I truly need is to just start writing. I want a simple setup
where I would just write text in Markdown format, convert it to static HTML +
CSS with as little dependencies as possible. I would love to write "on the go"
with any computer I would have (regardless of whether it's a MacBook, Linux
desktop or Windows gaming PC). I also want it to be stable and not depend on
services that might cease to exist or simply change their course to a direction
I am not very happy with.

## The dream setup

- Hugo + GitHub Pages + GitHub Actions
- Tailwind CSS + Claude Code for design
- Devcontainers + Codespaces + VSCode
