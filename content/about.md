# About

## Work

I graduated from [Moscow Institute of Physics and
Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow_Institute_of_Physics_and_Technology)
(which has a long history of producing world-class physicists and Nobel prize
winners) with a Bachelor degree in Applied Mathematics and Physics. In the
freshman year I became interested in Computer Science and participated Google
Summer of Code.  I built a [Clang-based tool for detecting copy-pasted
code](https://github.com/kirillbobyrev/code-clone-detection-llvm-devmtg15-poster)
in open-source projects over the summer and got an offer for an internship at
Google where a team also worked on static analysis. I worked on C++ tools such
as [clang-rename](https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-rename.html) and
[Clang-Tidy](https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/index.html), dived deeper
into Clang and the compiler's internals.

I enjoyed my time at Google and another internship at the same team in Munich.
This time, I have worked on [clangd](https://clangd.llvm.org/), Clang-based
language server for C++. During the summer, I have re-built the code completion
search engine which resulted in up to **100x performance improvement**! I
carefully documented the project's
[design](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1C-A6PGT6TynyaX4PXyExNMiGmJ2jL1UwV91Kyx11gOI/)
and [presented it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhxrFor3VyQ) at the LLVM
Developers Meeting.

My language of choice is usually C++, Rust or Python.
