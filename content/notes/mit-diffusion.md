Diffusion is taking the world of generative machine learning by storm and there
are two MIT courses on diffusion models that were just released publicly:

- [A Practical Introduction to Diffusion Models](https://www.practical-diffusion.org/)
- [Introduction to Flow Matching and Diffusion Models](https://diffusion.csail.mit.edu/)

Both are amazing if you want to learn more about diffusion. I'm working through
them, too, as I recently started working on diffusion-based models at work.
