I've long been skeptical of "vibe coding" and AI-driven tools like Cursor and
GitHub Copilot. However, the recent Agents updates completely changed my
perspective. After giving them a genuine try, I was able to quickly build a
clean, "Twitter-like" feed for my personal blog notes in just a few minutes.
Impressively, Claude 3.7 Sonnet Thinking nailed the implementation in a single
go, and I'm genuinely pleased with the outcome.

While crafting blog posts and personal notes brings me joy, coding HTML and
wrestling with CSS rarely does. Tools like Copilot and Cursor have significantly
boosted my productivity, letting me focus more on writing and less on tedious
styling.
