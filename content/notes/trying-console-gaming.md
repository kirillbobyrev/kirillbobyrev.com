I've been a PC gamer my whole life, but I recently picked up PS5 Pro (mostly in
anticipation of the GTA 6 release later this year) to try out console gaming.
The experience is noticeably different. The UI/UX feels a bit outdated, the
controller isn’t as comfortable, and the pricing model (with mandatory PS Plus
for some features like online play in many games) is more aggressive than
Steam’s. Still, the plug‐and‐play convenience is a big plus if you’d rather skip
building, setting up and maintaining your own PC.
