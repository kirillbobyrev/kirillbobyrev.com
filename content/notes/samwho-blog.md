Today I read about [reservoir sampling](https://samwho.dev/reservoir-sampling/)
in one of my favorite blogs - [samwho.dev](https://samwho.dev/). As a visual
learner, I really enjoy explanations featuring fancy graphics and interactive
visualizations. Too often in mathematics we are dealing with very dry texts and
long chains of logical statements, but internalizing it is often very difficult.
Today's tools (such as Jupyter Notebooks, Manim, JavaScript libraries for
visualization) are a great way to bridge that gap and make learning much more
fun.

If you haven't seen Sam's blog - definitely check it out, there are many
interesting posts featuring amazing visuals.
