Just dove into the console world with a PlayStation 5 Pro after a lifetime of PC
gaming! Initial thoughts:

* **Simplicity wins:** The user experience is undeniably streamlined â€“ no
  more PC maintenance headaches!
* **Controller magic:** Some games, like Ghost of Tsushima, feel incredible
  with the PS5 controller's features.
* **Pricey games:** Ouch, the cost of games is definitely higher.
* **Library lock-in:** Missing the cross-platform library sharing (though
  that [might
  change](https://www.theverge.com/news/633478/microsoft-xbox-steam-games-support-ui)
  on Xbox?).
* **App design:** The PS App UI could definitely be better. It looks quite
  clunky right now.

Ultimately, it's a fun new experience! Playing on a big screen and co-op with
friends is great.

Also, PlayStation 5 still offers plenty of exclusives and day one releases. Even
though they eventually come to PC, having access to them from the release date
is really nice.
