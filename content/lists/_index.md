A collection of curated resources on topics I find interesting. Each list
contains papers, tools, tutorials, and other materials I've found valuable for
understanding and working with these technologies.

These aren't comprehensive surveys - they're personal collections of resources
that have shaped my understanding or that I regularly reference. I try to add
context about why each resource is worth your time.
