Silicon Valley. I&rsquo;m passionate about machine learning and reinforcement
learning, efficient algorithms, high-performance code, distributed systems and
low-level programming.</p><h2 id=work-and-education>Work and education</h2><p>I grew up in &#x1f1f7;&#x1f1fa; Moscow and graduated from
<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow_Institute_of_Physics_and_Technology>MIPT</a>
with a Bachelorâ€™s degree in applied mathematics and physics. During my first
year at the university, I discovered my interest in computer science and started
participating in competitive programming contests. Later, I got the chance to
take part in <a href=https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/>Google Summer of Code</a>,
where I built a tool using Clang to find copypasted code in open-source projects
(see
<a href=https://github.com/kirillbobyrev/code-clone-detection-llvm-devmtg15-poster>poster</a>).
This led to an internship offer at Google. During my internship, I worked on
developing static analysis tools for C++ like
<a href=https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-rename.html>clang-rename</a> and
<a href=https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/index.html>Clang-Tidy</a>. It was super
fun, and I learned a lot about how Clang and compilers work behind the scenes.</p><p>My second internship was also in Google Munich. This time I have worked on
<a href=https://clangd.llvm.org/>clangd</a>, Clang-based language server for C++. I have
built the code completion search engine which resulted in up to 100x performance
improvement! I carefully documented project&rsquo;s
<a href=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1C-A6PGT6TynyaX4PXyExNMiGmJ2jL1UwV91Kyx11gOI/>design</a>
and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhxrFor3VyQ">presented the results</a> at the
LLVM Developers Meeting.</p><p>After graduation I joined the team at &#x1f1e9;&#x1f1ea; Google Munich where
I was an intern. At Google I was working on clangd, Clang and LLVM. Among other
things, I have built <a href=https://clangd.llvm.org/design/remote-index>Remote Index</a>
and <a href=https://clangd.llvm.org/design/include-cleaner>Include Cleaner</a>. In the
absence of a Product Manager in our team, I acted as one - learning what
features our users want, conducting UX interviews and surveys, processing
feedback and prioritizing the most pressing issues. I previously studied in
Yandex School of Management
(<a href=https://academy.yandex.ru/schools/management>Ð¨ÐœÐ¯</a>) which helped me develop
enough expertise to take on Product Manager or Project Manager responsibilities.</p><p>In 2022 I have joined <a href=https://waymo.com/>Waymo</a>, Google&rsquo;s self-driving cars
unit, and moved to &#x1f1fa;&#x1f1f8; California. At Waymo I build Machine Learning models
that improve <a href=https://waymo.com/blog/2021/07/simulation-city>Simulation</a>
realism and ensure safety of our self-driving system.</p><h2 id=outside-of-work>Outside of work</h2><ul><li>When I&rsquo;m not working, I enjoy training Jiu Jitsu, playing chess and
traveling.</li><li>I like competitive programming and studying computer science (here&rsquo;s a
<a href=https://github.com/kirillbobyrev/computer-science-resources>collection</a> of
resources I found for myself).</li><li>I speak English, Russian and German.</li><li>I&rsquo;m also living with two crazy Abyssinian kittens &#x1f431;, check out <a href=https://instagram.com/dixie_pixie_cats>their
Instagram</a>.</li></ul></main></body></html>
