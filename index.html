I work on
simulation and build machine learning models to make self-driving vehicles
safer.</p><h3 id=work--education>Work & Education</h3><p>I grew up in &#x1f1f7;&#x1f1fa; Moscow and earned my bachelor’s degree in applied mathematics
and physics from
<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow_Institute_of_Physics_and_Technology>MIPT</a>.
My journey into computer science started during my first year at university
through competitive programming. Soon after, I participated in <a href=https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/>Google Summer of
Code</a>, where I developed a Clang-based
tool to detect copypasted code in open-source projects (you can check out the
<a href=https://github.com/kirillbobyrev/code-clone-detection-llvm-devmtg15-poster>poster</a>
for details). This project led to an internship at Google, where I had a blast
working on static analysis tools for C++, including
<a href=https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-rename.html>clang-rename</a> and
<a href=https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/index.html>Clang-Tidy</a>. I gained
invaluable insights into the inner workings of Clang and compilers.</p><p>My next challenge was in Munich with Google, where I contributed to
<a href=https://clangd.llvm.org/>clangd</a>, the Clang-based language server for C++. I
built a code completion search engine that boosted performance by up to 100x! I
documented the project’s
<a href=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1C-A6PGT6TynyaX4PXyExNMiGmJ2jL1UwV91Kyx11gOI/>design</a>
and showcased my results at the LLVM Developers Meeting through a
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhxrFor3VyQ">presentation</a>. After graduation,
I rejoined the team in &#x1f1e9;&#x1f1ea; Munich at Google, working extensively on clangd,
Clang, and LLVM. I developed key tools like <a href=https://clangd.llvm.org/design/remote-index>Remote
Index</a> and <a href=https://clangd.llvm.org/design/include-cleaner>Include
Cleaner</a>. In a team without a
dedicated product manager, I stepped up to bridge that gap - conducting UX
interviews, running surveys, gathering feedback, and prioritizing user needs. My
time at the Yandex School of Management
(<a href=https://academy.yandex.ru/schools/management>ШМЯ</a>) also equipped me with the
skills to manage product and project initiatives.</p><p>In 2022, I embarked on a new adventure by joining <a href=https://waymo.com/>Waymo</a>,
the pioneering self-driving car unit of Google, and moved to California. At
Waymo, I build machine learning models that enhance simulation realism and help
ensure the safety of our self-driving systems.</p><h3 id=outside-of-work>Outside of Work</h3><p>When I&rsquo;m not working, you&rsquo;ll find me training in Jiu Jitsu, playing opponents in
chess, or exploring new places. I also enjoy competitive programming and
learning more about computer science and machine learning (through a <a href=https://github.com/kirillbobyrev/computer-science-resources>collection
of resources</a> I&rsquo;ve
gathered). I’m fluent in English, Russian, and German, and I live with two
mischievous Abyssinian cats.</p></article></main></div></body></html>
