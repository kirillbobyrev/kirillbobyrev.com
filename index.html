I build machine learning models
that improve simulation realism and help ensure the safety of our self-driving
systems.</p><h3 id=work--education>Work & Education</h3><p>I received my bachelorâ€™s degree in applied mathematics and physics from
<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow_Institute_of_Physics_and_Technology>MIPT</a>.
My journey into computer science started with a fascination for competitive
programming when I was a freshman. Soon after, I participated in <a href=https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/>Google Summer
of Code</a> and built Clang-based tool to
detect copy-pasted code in open-source projects (can check out <a href=https://github.com/kirillbobyrev/code-clone-detection-llvm-devmtg15-poster>LLVM Dev Meeting
2015 poster</a>).
This project led to an internship at Google, where I had built static analysis
tools for C++, including
<a href=https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-rename.html>clang-rename</a> and
<a href=https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/index.html>Clang-Tidy</a> checkers. I
learned a lot about the C++ ecosystem and the LLVM project, and I also
contributed to the <a href=https://clang-analyzer.llvm.org/>Clang Static Analyzer</a>.</p><p>My next challenge was with Google, where I contributed to
<a href=https://clangd.llvm.org/>clangd</a>, the Clang-based language server for C++. I
built a code completion search engine that boosted performance by up to 100x! I
presented project&rsquo;s
<a href=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1C-A6PGT6TynyaX4PXyExNMiGmJ2jL1UwV91Kyx11gOI/>design</a>
and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhxrFor3VyQ">showcased results</a> at the LLVM
Developers Meeting 2019.</p><p>After graduation, I rejoined the team at Google where I had interned, this time
working extensively on clangd, Clang, and LLVM. I developed key tools like
<a href=https://clangd.llvm.org/design/remote-index>Remote Index</a> and <a href=https://clangd.llvm.org/design/include-cleaner>Include
Cleaner</a>. In a team without a
dedicated product manager, I stepped up to bridge that gap - conducting UX
interviews, running surveys, gathering feedback, and prioritizing user needs. My
time at the Yandex School of Management
(<a href=https://academy.yandex.ru/schools/management>Ð¨ÐœÐ¯</a>) also equipped me with the
skills to manage product and project initiatives.</p><p>In 2022, I embarked on a new adventure by joining <a href=https://waymo.com/>Waymo</a>,
the self-driving car unit of Google and Alphabet. At Waymo, I build machine
learning models that enhance simulation realism and help ensure the safety of
our self-driving systems.</p><h3 id=outside-of-work>Outside of Work</h3><p>When I&rsquo;m not working, you&rsquo;ll find me training in Jiu Jitsu, playing opponents in
chess, or exploring new places. I also enjoy competitive programming and
learning more about computer science and machine learning (through a <a href=https://github.com/kirillbobyrev/computer-science-resources>collection
of resources</a> I&rsquo;ve
gathered). Iâ€™m fluent in English, Russian, and German, and I live with two
mischievous Abyssinian cats.</p></article></main></div></body></html>
