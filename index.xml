Similarly, longest streaks by Magnus Carlsen (32 wins), Nihal Sarin (22 wins), and Daniel Naroditsky (33 wins) align with statistical expectations. The occurrence of both short (10+ wins) and long (15+ wins) streaks among these elite players is also found to be probable and not out of the ordinary.</description></item></channel></rss>
