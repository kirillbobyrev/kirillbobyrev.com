In the first year I became interested in computer science. I enjoyed doing competitive programming and then participated in Google Summer of Code. In GSoC I have built a Clang-based tool for detecting copy-pasted code in open-source projects over the summer and got an offer for an internship at Google to work on static analysis tooling.</description></item></channel></rss>
