fascinated by the quality of both explanations and the accompanying
visualizations. Animations and visual explanations both help keep the attention
and also improve my understanding a lot, since I&amp;rsquo;m definitely a visual learner.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/3blue1brown">3Blue1Brown&lt;/a> is probably one of the
most popular channels that features great visuals to explain a large number of
interesting concepts of Mathematics and Computer Science. Channel author even
created and open-sourced the software that he uses for all animations and put
it on GitHub: &lt;a href="https://github.com/3b1b/manim">3b1b/manim&lt;/a>. But apparently it
was forked into
&lt;a href="https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/">ManimCommunity/manim&lt;/a>, which
features an enhanced version of the package with more thorough testing,
documentation and better user experience. The community also has active Discord
and a bunch of impressive

the learning process while making sure I don&amp;rsquo;t forget things I already learned
along the way is an important topic for me. &lt;a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki&lt;/a> is
one of the best tools I found for myself to make the learning process enjoyable
and efficient.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="why-anki">Why Anki?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Anki is far more than just a flashcard app—it&amp;rsquo;s a robust system built on the
principles of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition">spaced
repetition&lt;/a>. This approach
optimizes your study sessions by spacing out reviews of material just before
you’re likely to forget, making your learning process both efficient and
effective.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Analyzing long win streaks in online chess</title><link>https://kirillbobyrev.com/blog/analyzing-long-win-streaks/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kirillbobyrev.com/blog/analyzing-long-win-streaks/</guid><description>&lt;p>In-depth analysis of recent data suggests a high likelihood of Hikaru
Nakamura achieving a 55-game winning streak in online blitz, based on thousands
of his games played this year (and even more likely given that Hikaru just
crossed 35,000 blitz games mark on Chess.com alone). Similarly, longest streaks
by Magnus Carlsen (32 wins), Nihal Sarin (22 wins), and Daniel Naroditsky (33
wins) align with statistical expectations. The occurrence of both short (10+
wins) and long (15+ wins) streaks among these elite players is also found to be
probable and not out of the ordinary. A simple explanation of Hikaru&amp;rsquo;s
performance is that he plays an enormous number of games online, is highly
skilled and (on average) has much weaker opponents than his peers (moreover, he
specifically &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDUCMEgYKrE&amp;amp;t=435s">mentions&lt;/a>
cherry-picking opponents in order to score many points and create good content).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title/><link>https://kirillbobyrev.com/notes/first-note/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Mar 2023 10:42:51 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kirillbobyrev.com/notes/first-note/</guid><description>&lt;p>Just dove into the console world with a PlayStation 5 Pro after a lifetime of PC
gaming! Initial thoughts:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Simplicity wins:&lt;/strong> The user experience is undeniably streamlined – no
more PC maintenance headaches!&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Controller magic:&lt;/strong> Some games, like Ghost of Tsushima, feel incredible
with the PS5 controller&amp;rsquo;s features.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Pricey games:&lt;/strong> Ouch, the cost of games is definitely higher.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Library lock-in:&lt;/strong> Missing the cross-platform library sharing (though
that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/633478/microsoft-xbox-steam-games-support-ui">might
change&lt;/a>
on Xbox?).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>App design:&lt;/strong> The PS App UI could definitely be better. It looks quite
clunky right now.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Ultimately, it&amp;rsquo;s a fun new experience! Playing on a big screen and co-op with
friends is great.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
