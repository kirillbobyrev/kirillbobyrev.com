After almost 10 years of using Vim and Neovim it feels like it&amp;rsquo;s finally time to move on to something else!
Vim&amp;rsquo;s philosophy, key bindings and motions became ingrained in my consciousness over time, but I&amp;rsquo;ve had numerous problems with it, too. Most notably, I was trying to make a full IDE out of my Neovim setup, and I didn&amp;rsquo;t see the tool for what it really was: an powerful and extensible text editor that shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be bloated too much.</description></item><item><title>About</title><link>https://kirillbobyrev.com/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kirillbobyrev.com/about/</guid><description>About Work and education I graduated from Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology with a Bachelor&amp;rsquo;s degree in applied mathematics and physics. In the first year I became interested in computer science. I enjoyed doing competitive programming and later participated in Google Summer of Code. During GSoC I have built a Clang-based tool for detecting copy-pasted code in open-source projects over the summer and got an offer for an internship at Google to work on static analysis tooling.</description></item></channel></rss>
