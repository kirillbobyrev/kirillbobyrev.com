I specialize in Compilers and Machine Learning. C++ and Python are typically my languages of choice, but I enjoy writing code in Rust and Haskell. I contribute to LLVM very often (my commits).
Before I joined Google full-time I was studying at the university and interning at Google, too.</description></item></channel></rss>
