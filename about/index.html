Technology</a>
with a Bachelor&rsquo;s degree in applied mathematics and physics. In the first year I
became interested in computer science. I enjoyed doing competitive programming
and later participated in <a href=https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/>Google Summer of
Code</a>. During GSoC I have built a
Clang-based <a href=https://github.com/kirillbobyrev/code-clone-detection-llvm-devmtg15-poster>tool for detecting copy-pasted
code</a>
in open-source projects over the summer and got an offer for an internship at
Google to work on static analysis tooling. I worked on C++ tools such as
<a href=https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-rename.html>clang-rename</a> and
<a href=https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/index.html>Clang-Tidy</a>, dived deeper
into Clang and the compiler&rsquo;s internals.</p><p>I enjoyed my time at Google and another internship at the same team in üá©üá™
Munich. This time I have worked on <a href=https://clangd.llvm.org/>clangd</a>,
Clang-based language server for C++. During the summer, I have built the code
completion search engine which resulted in up to <strong>100x</strong> performance
improvement! I carefully documented the project&rsquo;s
<a href=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1C-A6PGT6TynyaX4PXyExNMiGmJ2jL1UwV91Kyx11gOI/>design</a>
and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhxrFor3VyQ">presented it</a> at the LLVM
Developers Meeting.</p><p>I also worked in the Machine Learning field for a while, studying and
researching convex optimization at the university and then joining
<a href=https://handl.ai/>Handl</a>, a Y-Combinator-backed startup to work on optical
character recognition.</p><p>After I graduated the university, I joined the at Google in Munich I did an
internship in and spent almost three years there improving clangd. Among other
things, I have built <a href=https://clangd.llvm.org/design/remote-index>Remote Index</a>
and <a href=https://clangd.llvm.org/design/include-cleaner>Include Cleaner</a>. In the
absence of a Product Manager in our team, I acted as one - learning what
features our users want, conducting UX interviews and surveys, processing
feedback and prioritizing the most pressing issues. I previously studied in
Yandex School of Management
(<a href=https://academy.yandex.ru/schools/management>–®–ú–Ø</a>) which helped me develop
enough expertise to take on Product Manager or Project Manager responsibilities.</p><p>In 2022 I have transferred to Waymo, Google&rsquo;s self-driving cars unit, and moved
to üá∫üá∏ California. At Waymo I work on
<a href=https://blog.waymo.com/2021/06/SimulationCity.html>Simulation</a> which helps us
ensure safety for our vehicles and the public, and allows rapid experimentation
with our software.</p><p>My programming language of choice is usually C++, Rust or Python.</p><h2 id=outside-of-work>Outside of work</h2><p>When I&rsquo;m not working, I enjoy training jiu-jitsu and Muay Thai, playing chess
online (<a href=https://lichess.org/@/kirillbobyrev>lichess.org/@/kirillbobyrev</a>) and
travel.</p><p>I like doing competitive programming tournaments on Codeforces
(<a href=https://codeforces.com/profile/kirillbobyrev>profile</a>) and studying computer
science (here&rsquo;s a
<a href=https://github.com/kirillbobyrev/computer-science-resources>collection</a> of
resources I want to study).</p><p>I&rsquo;m also living with two crazy Abyssinian kittens üê±, check out <a href=https://instagram.com/dixie_pixie_cats/>their
