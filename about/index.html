<p>Hi, I&rsquo;m Kirill — a Software Engineer at Google working on Clangd, C++ Language
Server implementation that helps you write better code in Visual Studio Code,
Vim and other editors. I specialize in Compilers and Machine Learning. C++ and
Python are typically my languages of choice, but I enjoy writing code in Rust
and Haskell. I contribute to LLVM very often (my commits).</p>
<p>Before I joined Google full-time I was studying at the university and interning
at Google, too. I enjoy building products and so I&rsquo;m naturally interested in
startups. While at university, I was doing Machine Learning and building Handl,
Machine Learning startup backed by Y Combinator.</p>
<p>Outside of work I enjoy reading (see latest books in my Goodreads profile), art,
chess and competitive programming.</p>
