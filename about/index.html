Technology</a>
with a Bachelor‚Äôs degree in applied mathematics and physics. During my first
year, I discovered my interest in computer science and started competing in
programming challenges. Later, I got the chance to participate in <a href=https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/>Google Summer
of Code</a>, where I built a tool using Clang
to find copy-pasted code in open-source projects (see
<a href=https://github.com/kirillbobyrev/code-clone-detection-llvm-devmtg15-poster>poster</a>
with results). This led to an internship offer at Google. During my internship,
I worked on developing static analysis tools for C++ like
<a href=https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-rename.html>clang-rename</a> and
<a href=https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/index.html>Clang-Tidy</a>. It was super
fun, and I learned a lot about how Clang and compilers work behind the scenes.</p><p>My second internship was also in Google Munich. This time I have worked on
<a href=https://clangd.llvm.org/>clangd</a>, Clang-based language server for C++. During
the summer, I have built the code completion search engine which resulted in up
to <strong>100x</strong> performance improvement! I carefully documented project&rsquo;s
<a href=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1C-A6PGT6TynyaX4PXyExNMiGmJ2jL1UwV91Kyx11gOI/>design</a>
and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhxrFor3VyQ">presented the results</a> at the
LLVM Developers Meeting.</p><p>I also worked in the Machine Learning field for a while, studying and
researching convex optimization at the university and then joining
<a href=https://handl.ai/>Handl</a>, a Y-Combinator-backed startup to work on optical
character recognition.</p><p>After I graduated the university, I joined the team at üá©üá™ Google Munich where
I was an intern. At Google I was working on clangd, Clang and LLVM. Among other
things, I have built <a href=https://clangd.llvm.org/design/remote-index>Remote Index</a>
and <a href=https://clangd.llvm.org/design/include-cleaner>Include Cleaner</a>. In the
absence of a Product Manager in our team, I acted as one - learning what
features our users want, conducting UX interviews and surveys, processing
feedback and prioritizing the most pressing issues. I previously studied in
Yandex School of Management
(<a href=https://academy.yandex.ru/schools/management>–®–ú–Ø</a>) which helped me develop
enough expertise to take on Product Manager or Project Manager responsibilities.</p><p>In 2022 I have transferred to <a href=https://waymo.com/>Waymo</a>, Google&rsquo;s self-driving
cars unit, and moved to üá∫üá∏ California. At Waymo I work on
<a href=https://blog.waymo.com/2021/06/SimulationCity.html>Simulation</a> which helps us
ensure safety for our vehicles and the public, and allows rapid experimentation
with our software.</p><p>My programming language of choice is usually C++, Rust or Python.</p><h2 id=outside-of-work>Outside of work</h2><p>When I&rsquo;m not working, I enjoy training jiu-jitsu and Muay Thai, playing chess
online and travel.</p><p>I like doing competitive programming and studying computer science (here&rsquo;s a
<a href=https://github.com/kirillbobyrev/computer-science-resources>collection</a> of
resources I want to study).</p><p>I&rsquo;m also living with two crazy Abyssinian kittens üê±, check out <a href=https://instagram.com/dixie_pixie_cats/>their
