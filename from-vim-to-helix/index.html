modal text editor for terminal. After almost 10 years of using Vim and Neovim it
feels like it&rsquo;s finally time to move on to something else!</p><p>Vim&rsquo;s philosophy, key bindings and motions became ingrained in my consciousness
over time, but I&rsquo;ve had numerous problems with it, too. Most notably, I was
trying to make a full IDE out of my Neovim setup, and I didn&rsquo;t see the tool for
what it really was: an powerful and extensible text editor that shouldn&rsquo;t be
bloated too much. I have probably spent hundreds of hours crafting my perfect
<code>.vimrc</code> and fixing integration issues with several Linux distributions and
macOS. I am now switching to Helix editor in terminal and Visual Studio Code
spending approximately half of the time in each while coding.</p><p>Few things I love about Helix compared to Vim:</p><ul><li>Choosing its niche</li><li>Embracing the LSP from the start</li><li>Minimalistic config and great defaults: if you need to do any serious coding,
Vim is not very useful out of the box. Even if you already know very well what
you are doing, getting it to a state where just looking at the code and
changing few lines comfortably will take a while. Neovim improves the defaults
slightly, but the config will still break from updates very often (especially
with plugins). Helix, on the other hand, doesn&rsquo;t force me to learn Vimscript
or Lua, install a dozen plugins and care about everything working well
together.</li><li>Modern language and development environment:</li></ul><p>In the end, I don&rsquo;t want my editor to be extensible in every way, I want the one
that works for me very well in a limited number of scenarios, and Helix is
exactly that. It is still very fresh and, just like any successful project, it
can become a victim of the feature bloat over time, but I hope it stays focused
on the niche it can shine in and continue improving. I look forward to using it
more and enjoying a hassle-free modal text editor in my terminal!</p><p>Ctrl + d</p></content><p><a href=https://kirillbobyrev.com/blog/today-i-learned/>#Today I Learned</a></p></main><footer></footer></body></html>
